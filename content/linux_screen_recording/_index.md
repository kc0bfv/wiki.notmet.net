I run Debian Linux generally, and occasionally need a way to record my laptop screen, webcam, and sound.  Here's a winning combo...

* Kazam - records what's on your screen and the sound
* recordmydesktop - works for screen recording too, it outputs an ogv file though, which may be tough to get into youtube
* guvcview - displays your webcam image on the screen so you can record it

For just recording the screen, especially if you'd be better with a GIF output, `Byzanz` is the best.

For video editing - kdenlive.  For audio recording - audacity.
