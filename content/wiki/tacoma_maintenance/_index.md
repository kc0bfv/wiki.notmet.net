This page describes the maintenance I've performed, and had performed, on my '07 Tacoma.

## Maintenance I Completed

### Oil and Filter Change - 75,700 Mi
I used synthetic oil.  I released the oil bolt first and let it drain.  Once it finished draining I removed the oil filter.  Even then, the filter sprayed a little oil when the pressure released between it and the engine.  Next time be ready for that - it's kinda messy.

### Serpentine Belt Change - 81,600 Mi
Belt Manufacturer: Gates, Model: K070901, Dimensions: 15/16" x 90-5/8".  This was pretty easy once I got the right sized belt.  The tensioner is the pulley to the left and top.  I think it's next to the alternator.  There's a metric-size (14 mm?  11 mm?) nub on the bottom left of it that a socket wrench can grab on.  Pull it clockwise to release tension.

### Headlights Change - 82,000 Mi
Sylvania SilverStars - replaced both

### Passenger Headlight Change - 90,000 Mi
Grumble.  The filament broke for the regular brightness passenger-side headlight.  The high-beam still worked.  I replaced just passenger side with a Sylvania SilverStar.

### New Battery / Headlight Cleanup - 125,900 Mi
The battery died over a few days' time, slowly getting harder and harder to start...  I replaced it with a 24F series Duralast battery from Autozone.

### Oil and Filter Change - 165,000 Mi
Valvoline High Mileage 5W-20 + Fram Extra Synthetic Filter 3614
Also did Sarah's 2013 Kia Soul, hers is at 72,000 Mi - same oil, same type of filter but a 9688

### Oil and Filter Change - 184k Mi
Valvoline High Mileage, 11 qts 10W-30 + Fram Extra Synthetic Filter 3614.  This oil was enough to do Sarah's 2013 Kia Soul too.  Hers is at 91k Mi, same brand and style of filter but a 9688.  For future reference, I used a 17mm socket for her oil drain plug.

### Headlight Cleanup - 185k Mi
Used a kit from 3M from Amazon.

### Headlight Bulb Change - 188k Mi
Changed driver-side bulb.  I used the second bulb in a two bulb pack, I must have used the other one around 180k, don't remember for which side though...

A week or so later I had to change the passenger-side bulb, too.  These things are so disappointing.  Went ahead and changed the wipers too, it was well past time for that...

### LED Headlights - 195k Mi
Receipt is probably on email.

### Added Oil - 197.2k Mi
I added 1.5qts to the halfway mark.  9 July 2019.

### New Battery - 200k Mi
Duralast AutoZone 24F battery, August 2019.

### 2 Qts Oil Added - 225k Mi
5 Oct 21

### LED Headlights and Headlight Cleanup - 247k Mi
16 Dec 2023 - those previous ones lasted me 50k, and then only the passenger side went out.  Got headlights and cleanup kit on Amazon.

### Added 3 qts oil - 250k Mi
30 Jan 2024.

### Added 3 qts oil - 256.6k Mi
19 Aug 2024.

## Third Party Maintenance

### Oil and Filter change - Around 60,000 Mi
At the San Anton dealership.

### Tire change - 89,100 Mi
I believe the tires Sam's Club removed are the original tires, so those lasted a long time.  The new tires are four new ''Michelin X Radial LT2 P245/75R16 109T'' tires.  I had Sam's take one of the old ones and make it the spare.  They told me the old spare had a nail in the sidewall, so that explains why it was losing air.  Unfortunately, the folks at Sam's broke 3 out of 4 of the center caps, that say ''Toyota''.  They're just plastic...  JB Weld may fix them well enough...

### Tire Change - 134k Mi
The front drivers tire got a chunk taken out of it while TDY to Dayton, OH.  Sam's Club replaced it and the driver's passenger side.  They couldn't get the old tires, so they replaced them with a new type.  I'll have to write it in here at some point...

### Other stuff in here ... before 165k Mi
Drive shaft change and full service at some point, several oil changes...  Toyota reimbursed me for the drive shaft change, later.

### Dealership Maintenance - 190k Mi
Toyota dealership did about $5k in maintenance and replacement parts here.

### Jiffy-Lube Oil Change - 201k Mi
Oil, filter, and cabin air filter change.

### Jiffy-Lube Oil Change - 208.4k Mi
Oil, filter, and cabin air filter change.  Just before we moved from Idaho.

### Valvoline Oil Change - 216k Mi
Oil change, nothing more.  Synthetic mix.

### Valvoline Oil Change - 225k Mi
Oil change, engine air filter change.  Synthetic mix.

### Valvoline Oil Change - 237k Mi
December 2022.  Oil change, inspection, battery "healthy" apparently.  Synthetic mix.

### Sun Auto Service - 243k Mi

July 2023.  Replaced alternator, replaced battery, replaced air filter and cabin air filter, cycled fluids, oil and filter replaced, replaced serpentine belt, replaced spark plugs, fuel injection service.  They said it also needs new tires and shock/struts (they're old).

### Tire Change - 252k

Discount Tire replaced all 4 tires and put one of the better tires in as spare, and replaced TPMS on all 5.  This was 23 March 2024.  Pathfinder HT 245/75 R16.  I think the front two tires hadn't been changed since 134k, and the back two since 89k...

### Valvoline Oil Change - 252k Mi

April 2024 oil change and air filter change.
